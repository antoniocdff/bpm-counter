Copy the bpm-counter.py in some DIRECTORY, open a terminal and change to it ($ is the command prompt on my Linux system):

> `$ cd DIRECTORY`

and either call the python interpreter with your file as argument (and submitting the input with the return key)

> `$ python bpm-counter.py`

**or**: First make the file executable

> `$ chmod +x bpm-counter.py`

and then you are able to execute the code directly:

> `$ ./bpm-counter.py`
